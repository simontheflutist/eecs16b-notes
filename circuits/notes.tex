\section{Introduction}
These are notes for EECS 16B, a freshman-level survey of topics in electrical engineering. I (Simon) mostly wrote them during the \href{https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/sp20/}{Spring 2020 semester} of EECS 16B paraphrasing, Prof.~Sanders's lectures the same semester.
The words and sentences are my own; however, I owe the graphics and some editing to Seth, and a fair bit of mistake-catching to our diligent students.

If you find a mistake or can suggest an improvement, \href{https://github.com/simontheflutist/eecs16b-notes}{let me know on GitHub}.
